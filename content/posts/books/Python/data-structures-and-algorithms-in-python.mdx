title: A good primer for your coding interview
book_title: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
last_updated: 2020-06-20
author: Waldo Lavaut
the_gist: Based on the authors' market leading data structures books in Java and C++, this textbook offers a comprehensive, definitive introduction to data structures in Python by respected authors. Data Structures and Algorithms in Python is the first mainstream object-oriented book available for the Python data structures course. Designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their design, analysis, and implementation, the text will maintain the same general structure as Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and Data Structures and Algorithms in C++.

    The word algorithm has always sound magical and scary to me. Learning a
    bunch can make you feel like a wizard with a bag full of Adamic tricks and a
    magic wand.
  </p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - Then...we come to the problem of not feeling smart enough.
</em>

<p>
  You can do this!! But you will need patience, determination, and constancy.
  Trace your goal, and enjoy the journey. That is what will take you there safe
  and sane.
</p>

<p>
  This book will help you get a robust knowledge of everything you need to know
  about computer algorithms. So you can get that FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon,
  Microsoft, Google ) dreamed job.
</p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - Great, how do I start?
</em>

<p>
  If you are not familiar with Python, then read{" "}
  <span className="text-teal-500 font-semibold">Chapter 1</span>.{" "}
  <span className="text-teal-500 font-semibold">Chapter 2</span> will teach you
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design patterns and principles, inheritance,
  shallow and deep copying.
</p>

<p>
  <span className="text-teal-500 font-semibold">Chapter 3</span> looks like a
  math crap. They go over the seven functions used in the book, only to show you
  what they mathematically represent. How is that useful to me? I'm not sure.
  They also mention the big Oh notation and some examples of algorithm analysis.
  I still find this specific chapter straitened in its objectives.{" "}
</p>

<p>
  <span className="text-teal-500 font-semibold">Chapters 4 to 8</span> are very
  robust! These will teach you a bunch of cool things about recursion,
  array-based sequences, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, all really good
  stuff. Do the same with{" "}
  <span className="text-teal-500 font-semibold">Chapters 9 to 12</span>
</p>

<p>
  The rest of the book after{" "}
  <span className="text-teal-500 font-semibold">Chapter 12</span> goes into a
  bunch of text processing and graph algorithms that I find kind of too deep for
  my understanding. If you want to become a competitive programmer, then yeah,
  learn all of this -hate to say- crap.
</p>

<p>
  Look at this book as that useful reference when you need to learn or refresh
  your knowledge on a specific algorithm problem. But don't put too much effort
  into thinking you need to understand every single thing in this book. It's not
  necessary. If you want to prepare for a coding interview, then go to{" "}
