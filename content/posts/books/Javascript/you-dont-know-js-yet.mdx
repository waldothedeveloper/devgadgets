<p>
  What a bold title for this book series! Let me tell you that even if you have
  lots of years of experience with Javascript, at some point, you will end up
  agreeing with Kyle.
</p>

<p>
  Getting these books in your hands feels like you won the lotto. The first
  thing you do is go to the dealer and get that Ferrari you've always wanted.
</p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - Or a Toyota...lol
</em>{" "}

<p>
  These series of books come with ravaging knowledge. There's no room for doubts
  after you finish reading them. They start with solid foundations and build
  their way up to objects and classes, sync & async, and finally diving into
  more advanced concepts like async flow control, APIs, metaprogramming, and ES6
  features.
</p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - So can I read these in any order?
</em>{" "}

<p>
  If you already know Javascript and have been working full-time on this
  language for some time (years preferably), then feel free to jump into any
  chapter. Otherwise, it's better just to read it in order.
</p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - Refresh my mind, what kind of things can I learn?
</em>{" "}

<p>
  Learn about scopes and closures. The sometimes confusing "this" keyword. Learn
  about prototypes, coercion, asynchronous javascript, and promises. There is a
  delightful chapter about testing and performance, ES6 features, APIs, and
  metaprogramming.
