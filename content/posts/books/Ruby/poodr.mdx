Practical Object-Oriented Design: An Agile Primer Using Ruby (POODR) is a programmers tale about how to write object-oriented code. It explains object-oriented design (OOD) using realistic, understandable examples.   POODR is a practical, readable introduction to how OOD can lower your costs and improve your applications.

POODR will help you:

Decide what belongs in a single class

Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate

Define flexible interfaces among objects

Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing

Successfully apply inheritance

Build objects via composition

Design cost-effective tests

Craft simple, straightforward, understandable code

If your code is killing you and the joy is gone, POODR has the cure.
