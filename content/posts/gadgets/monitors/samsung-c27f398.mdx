<h3>Toss your old chunky monitor</h3>

<p>
  I don't mean to add that adjective to your old monitor, though but, I have
  slim news. This monitor is less than 0.5 inches thick, in an immersive 27
  inches curved screen. I'm about to show you some of the things I love about
  this simple yet, affordable Samsung monitor.
</p>

<h3>That curve on your eyes</h3>

<p>
  The curve of human eyes served as an inspiration to design curved screens. Did
  you know that? The 1800R aims to provide a big, bold, and stunning panoramic
  view. That doesn't mean you are going to see now a breathtaking 4K motion
  picture, this isn't the monitor for that, but at its 1920 x 1080 pixels, I
  believe it displays a solid image.
</p>

<h3>All colors matter</h3>

<p>
  Samsung has nailed down the secret to the almost perfect matching color. The
  technology put on this one is called Samsung's Active Crystal Color. How they
  achieve such deep blacks and bright whites? Well, this monitor offers an
  excellent 3000:1 contrast ratio, meaning you will still see even in the
  darkest or brightest scenes.

<h3>The gaming experience</h3>

<p>
  I use to play a lot when I was younger. If you are still an active gamer, this
  monitor is the shit (on a budget) for games. They put some AMD FreeSync tech
  to sync the screen refresh rate with the frame rate of your content,
  minimizing input latency and reducing image tearing. Simply put, less motion
  blur, less judder, and less ghosting.
</p>

<h3>Caring for your eyes</h3>

<p>
  A nice feature of this monitor is the eye saver mode. Think how wonderful is
  this when you want to read documents or cry looking at your bills, especially
  for long periods. Bye-bye eye strain, see you later eye fatigue.{" "}
</p>

<p>
  For the rest, they are a breeze to assemble. Make sure you look for any dead
  pixels or weird color lines just in case after purchasing it, this can happen
  even to the most expensive displays. My dear friend, this is Samsung. It
  doesn't let you down. Smash that checkout button!
