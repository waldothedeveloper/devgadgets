the_gist: There’s no perfect monitor for everyone, but this Dell monitor offers the best balance of resolution, design, features, and price. First off, it measures 27 inches diagonally, which is the ideal size for a standard office desk. It’s also 1440p (QHD), which is the perfect happy medium between affordable 1080p and super-sharp 4K.
