the_gist: Stop. You won't find a better standing desk frame. This is the best frame outthere in combination with an Ikea table for your next desk upgrade. Wait until you'll see how my desk was before and after the change.

  Smart desks today are expensive, we all know it. If you are willing to spend
  big chunks of money on one, let me know and I'll write you a poem about
  Amazon. For example, the Autonomous company offers many of them with
  interesting options. You can take a look at them{" "}

<p>
  On the other hand, if you are looking for an affordable desk at a decent
  price, with the option of a custom wood tabletop where you pick the size, - I
  got mine at IKEA for example -, then you came to the right place.
</p>

<h3>The disaster of my old desk</h3>

<p>
  Take a look at a photo of my previous old desk, as you can see it was a mess.
  It was small, and I couldn't fit too many things around like an extra monitor,
  a pair of headphones, etc.
</p>

<p>
  The next photo is how your desk might look like after getting the Vivo
  Standing Desk Frame, with an IKEA wood countertop table, and the Vivo monitor
  stand. Look at this wonder for the modern work-at-home human.

<h3>The tabletop of your dreams</h3>

<p>
  Let's start with a tabletop that you can find at IKEA. At the time I bought
  the IKEA table, I chose the Hammarp model, which is made of Oak. But, if you
  don't find it, you can choose any color/model{" "}
  <a

    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/search/products/?q=hammarp"
  >
    here
  </a>
  . <br />
  Make sure you choose a model that's not above 85'' long, since this Vivo frame
  can hold a length between 41'' to 85'', a width of 23'' to 44'', and a
  thickness of 3/4'' or greater. I personally like{" "}

  but you can get anyone you like.

<p>
  Optionally, you can buy if you wish a 60'' x 24'' inches universal tabletop
  for this frame, made also from the Vivo company{" "}

  .{` `}
  With a similar price and nice rounded edges, it is also an alternative but
  they use what it's called 'engineered wood' - also known as mass timber or
  man-made wood -, which is probably not as good quality as the IKEA tabletops.
  Alright, that's all you need regarding the tabletops, let's take a look at the
  VIVO desk frame.

<h3>A smart ergonomic desk frame</h3>
<p>
  It comes with a single-motor electric engine and all-steel construction
  capable of holding up to{" "}
  <span className="font-semibold text-base text-teal-500">176 lbs</span>. They
  have a 3-year manufacturer warranty but, and above that, they have an amazing
  support team, and you will want to know why. The other day my desk was stuck
  at a specific height, I couldn't get it to go lower beyond some point, so I
  started to chat with one of their specialists and they were able to help me
  super fast. That's something I value a lot after I purchase a product.
</p>

<h3>S is for Smart craftmanship</h3>
<p>
  The smart control panel comes features an elegant touch screen with a timer to
  remind you to stand throughout your day. Also, has 3 memory presets to easily
  find your ideal height and a nice power saving mode feature that automatically
  activates after 60 seconds of inactivity.

  />
</div>
<h3>Additional accessories</h3>
<p>
  It also comes with a cable management rack 23'' x 4'' included to help keep
  cords organized, but you can buy an additional one and install it on the back
  of the table for another extra cable management solution{` `}

  />

<p>
  For your favorite headphones, they also sell this ergonomic black metal
  clamp-on headphone holder. And as you see in the picture, it can hold a
  variety of things. I strongly recommend you to get it{" "}

  at your desk.
