<Question>1. Ultra-fast scrolling speed</Question>
<Response>
The scroll wheel on this mouse comes with
  what Logitech calls the{" "}
<span className="text-teal-400 tracking-wider"> &ldquo;Electromagnetic MagSpeed wheel&rdquo;</span>
. This special wheel can scroll 90% faster than a regular mouse. This is some mind blowing speed!. One thing I've noticed though is that the sweat of your fingers can make that cool steel looking wheel a bit green so try to clean it sometimes if you think your hands are a little sweaty. Regardless or that I've never seen any loss in usability or speed, which again, it is some serious sh<span className="text-red-600">*</span>t!

<Question>2. App-specific customizations</Question>
<Response>Calling out photographers, videographers, spreadsheet wizards, designers, developers, you name it. Working on Final Cut Pro? No problem, you can pan, undo & redo, or horizontally scroll with the same buttons that lets you go back & forth and navigate between tabs or even open a link in a new tab in any browser. The app specific customizations are really dope, and Apple is calling their mouse magic? This Logitech mouse is the real magic!</Response>

<Question>3. Multiple computers, one flow</Question>
<Response>
  Do you have a gaming station and a work-laptop? Well, this mouse will allow
  you to control both devices simply by moving your cursor to the edge of the
  screen. What, it's that easy? Yes Sr., you can do this even between Windows
  and Mac OS operating systems. The Logitech team came up with the{" "}
  <span className="text-teal-400 tracking-wider">
    &ldquo;Logi Options&rdquo;
  </span>{" "}
  software which you download, install, and then you enable the flow option that
  allows you to copy files between both devices. Have in mind that they need to
  be paired with the mouse first and be in the same network, meaning they should
  be connected to the same Wi-Fi at home. With these two couple of steps you can
  easily transfer anything using a secure SSL, AWS-256 bit encryption
  connection.

<Question>4. USB-C to USB-C Charging</Question>
<Response>
  After I'll tell you this you'd throw away your apple magic mouse, answer me:
  Can you use it while it's chaging? Aaaaannnddd...nope, you can't use the Apple
  Magic mouse, but the Logitech, you certainly can. And 1 full charge last up to
  70 days, I'll tell you more, if you charge it for just 1 minute it will last 3
  hours. That's it, you can't beat that.
</Response>

<Question>5. Works with an Ipad</Question>
<Response>
  What? No way...Yes, you can even use it with an Ipad that currently runs
  iPadOS. üòÆüòÆüòÆ &nbsp; So if you need to work on the go you can get a nice iPad
  keyboard like this [NEED TO PUT THE LINK HERE] and then get the Logitech mouse
  and you'll be using your iPad like a pro computer.
