the_gist: I'll start being honest. This is NOT my fav headphones. They can be a bit tight when you put them on, but there are things I have learned to love about it, and you will love too.

  <h3>A difficult decision</h3>

<p>
  Deciding on a great pair of headphones can become a bit of a stressful task.
  And there are many things to consider. For example, battery life, size and
  comfort, wired or wireless, noise cancellation, impedance, and frequency
  response. The list can go on. Then we come to the price, hum...especially the
  price.
</p>

  - First impressions matter...
</em>{" "}

<p>
  And it does. The unboxing experience of these headphones is notably
  satisfying. It comes with everything you would need.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>User manual</li>
  <li>Stickers</li>
  <li>Charging cable</li>
  <li>Protecting traveling case</li>
  <li>Warranty card</li>
  <li>Headhphones</li>
</ul>

<h3>The rule of 3</h3>

<p>
  These headphones are extremely popular with the youth and for 3 good reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are simple to pair with Apple products. </li>
  <li>
    They provide up to 40 hours of battery life and a little LEDs to show how
    much battery do you have.
  </li>
  <li>
    The sound quality is robust, well balanced and it comes with some noise
    isolation.
  </li>
</ul>

  - Can I call my boo with these headphones, though?
</em>{" "}

<p>
  Yes, you can make calls with it, so call you mama, your dad, call Siri and ask
  her where's your boo if you want. The integrated microphone is super decent.
  It is not noise canceling but, the comfort cushion ear cups buffer pretty much
  the outside noise. Also, it is foldable, which definitely helps if you want to
  put it away in a small space.
</p>

<h3>No strings attached</h3>

<p>
  Yes, they are completely wireless, so your prayers have been heard. It only
  has two buttons. One is to turn on and off the headphones, the other one - the
  big one - assist with stop/resume the music, pick up calls, and hang up.{" "}
</p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - But they are pricey, though...
</em>{" "}

<p>
  I agree. But have in mind that a premium headphones with similar or better features can start close to the $400s.  So the "Beats" beats the price well enough. Getting these premium headphones renewed is saving you $60 bucks on your paycheck. You can't disagree with that, so go get them before they're gone.
