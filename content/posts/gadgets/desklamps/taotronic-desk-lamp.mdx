The Taotronics LED Desk Lamp with Dimmable and a USB charging port, 5 lightning modes and 7 brightness levels. I've had mine for 3 years already and it still in perfect shape. This is must buy!.

  A five stars product with more than 18 thousand reviews for a desk-lamp? Yeah.
  Right... You must be thinking I am lying to you. But the truth is that even
  the newer model of this lamp has also 5 stars out of 1,920 ratings on Amazon,
  so Taotronics is doing a really good job with their LED desk-lamps. Feel free
  to get their slick newer model{" "}

  if you like it more, or let's find the truth about this popular previous
  model.
</p>

<h3>The colors of the rainbow</h3>
<p>
  This LED desk-lamp comes in black, black wood grain, white, and white wood
  grain. I know you had already a pride color desk-lamp in your mind right?
  Well, maybe they'll listen next time. The cheapest is the black one, the most
  expensive one is the white wood grain one.
</p>

<h3>I like to move it move it üé∂</h3>
<p>
  For real this desk-lamp sometimes makes me think it's more flexible than a
  yoga guru. You can put it in 3 million different angles, like for example the
  head moves left/right in 90 degrees and the base of the arm moves up/down 135
  degrees, taking the light where you need it most.

</div>

<h3>I like to charge it charge it üé∂</h3>
<p>
  A convenient USB port located in the back of the base of the arm base to help
  you to charge your iPhone, iPad, even the tiny remote-controlled red
  helicopter üöÅ {` `}that I keep in my desk to fly when I'm bored.

  />
</div>

<h3>You like to...touch it üé∂</h3>
<p>
  A finger slide panel is built into the base of the lamp to set the brightness
  level of your choice, so DIMM it like a pro. I like how sensible is it like
  you can easily slide your finger and it instantly responds to your gestures. I
  got it this lamp in 2017, and it has never given me any trouble. The other
  button on the base is for the 5 color modes, yes...it includes the soft gold
  color you want for the avid readers, and more importantly, it does not flick.
  Ever.

<h3>But it doesn't...</h3>
<p>Wait, but this lamp doesn't include an app? And why is it not battery powered? Why doesn't tell me the weather? I get it. But this is a <span className="text-teal-500 font-semibold">LED desk-lamp</span> my friend, not a Ferrari. Its simplicity is what makes it cool. Go get it!</p>
