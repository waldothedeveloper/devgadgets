the_gist: I've had a few keyboards, but I never felt completely satisfied with any of them, so after buying the MX master 2S -recommended by Wes Bos- mouse I discovered they also have a keyboard for programmers.

<p>There is an old saying that goes like this: </p>
<blockquote style={{color: "#475569"}} className="text-base">A little axe can cut down a big tree.</blockquote>
<p> This extraordinary keyboard can certainly cut down a lot of frustration. It was designed for creative minds and engineered for developers. I've had a few keyboards, starting with the Apple Magic keyboard, pffsss...nothing magic about it. Later on a mechanical one from Azio, which was much better but too noisy, and now the Logitech MX Keys. Gosh!!! it lets you type like a real ninja.</p>
  
<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600"> - although ninjas probably don't sit on computers.</em>

<h3>So what you love about it?</h3>
<p>
  Let's start with the soft, fluid, precise stroke keys. The spherically dished
  keys - kind of a mouthy word ha - match the tip of your fingers, and with
  rounded edged provides a very satisfying feeling. So not only are they keys
  completely out of this world, they are almost totally silent...did you hear
  me? But, if you wanna bang your keyboard, well...that's up to you.
</p>

<h3>A keyboard with comfort and stability</h3>
<p>
  Most keyboards -including the Apple magic one- are pretty weightless, I guess
  they cut on quality materials for cheaper and more accessible ones, but this
  one my friend, this one is one of a kind. The entire body of this keyboard is
  held together by a single metal plate. So be very careful with that cup of
  coffee...this keyboard doesn't slide easily.

<h3>Smart 'illuminati' keyboard</h3>
<p>
  I should say instead 'smart ass illuminated keyboard'. The MX keys come
  equipped with proximity sensors that detect your hands to illuminate the keys
  the moment your fingers approach.{" "}
  <em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">Say what?</em> Yep,
  and they fade off when you leave your desk. This makes this keyboard a smart
  ass power-saving device. Even more, the backlight intensity adapts to lighting
  conditions in the room. So...yes, this keyboard is 'illuminati confirmed'.
  Tell the Apple magic mouse to do something like this...yeah right.
</p>

<h3>Works in multiple computers</h3>
<p>
  Now I'm really gonna blow your mind. Pair this keyboard with a Logitech mouse
  like the MX master 3, and guess what? It follows your mouse from one computer
  to another.
</p>
<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">

<p>
  As you hear it, even to transfer files between @Mac and @Windows operating
  systems, but both computers need to be connected to the same Wi-fi network.

<h3>USB-C rechargeable</h3>
<p>
  According to the Logitech manufacturer, it can stand a hurricane category 5
  for 10 days on a full charge, and up to 5... -Did I said five?- ok, so yes,
  five months with backlighting turned off. The recipe is simple, charge it with
  a USB-C cable, and enjoy it from 10 days to 5 months, with or without a
  hurricane.

  - I'm kidding about the hurricane though
