the_gist: The Yamaha HS8 studio speakers are a genuine industry standard for a reason - their accuracy. I have not seen anything more precise as a sound reference within this price range, which by the way, it's not the cheapest either.

 No matter what type of technology enthusiast you are (programmer, designer, blogger, manager), if you clicked on this article is because you love music as much as I do, and/or you're interested in buying some serious piece of sound equipment for your next bombastic project. Listen up, the symphony is about to begin.
</p>

<h3>The unmistakable sound of a Ferrari</h3>

<p>
  Have you ever turned on a Ferrari, if you don't go ahead and google really
  quick how does it sound. Did you hear it? Well, as you saw the sound of a
  Ferrari is truly unmistakable. These Yamaha HS8 speakers have the 'Ferrari'
  sound for your music enjoyment, music production, mixing, or whatever you want
  to hear.
</p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - So how they came up with that genius sound?
</em>{" "}

<h3>The energy flow of the sound</h3>

<p>
  Yamaha is very meticulous in all its products, so for the HS series, they
  developed transducers capable of achieving an astonishingly smooth response.
  By using an advanced magnetic field design, they regulate the flow of the
  sound to provide seamless, natural and high resolution sonic transitions. All
  this means is you can hear literally everything, from noise to rumble.

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - I really would like to buy it but tell me more...
</em>{" "}

<h3>A high-performance amp unit</h3>

<p>
  The entire Yamaha HS series comes equipped with a bi-amp with a separate
  dedicated amp for both the woofer and the tweeter. Meaning that it will
  consistently deliver high-resolution sound with an incredible flat response
  across the sound spectrum.
</p>

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - I feel like I need you to translate that...
</em>{" "}

<p>
  Think about this, many cheap and badly designed speakers not only lack a flat
  sound response, but they usually come with a single amp that tries to
  digitally adjust the sound resolution, ending in useless bass boosters or
  noisy highs.

<h3>Controls and connectivity</h3>

  Knowing how to and the best way to place your speakers -{" "}

  </a>{" "}
  - is a vital part of the wholesome experience. Additionally, the Yamaha HS
  series comes with what they call{" "}
  <span className="text-teal-500">ROOM CONTROL</span>. Basically, you can
  attenuate and control the unnatural low-end or high frequencies when speakers
  are placed next to walls. For inputs, HS full-range speakers can accommodate a
  wide range of balanced and unbalanced sources such as mixers, keyboards, and
  audio interfaces with XLR and TRS phone jacks.

<em className="text-base font-semibold text-cool-gray-600">
  - There has to be something bad about them...

<h3>They might be an unexpected surprise for your wallet</h3>
<p>
  The only bad news I can say is that they are pricey, just imagine: only one
  costs sometimes <span className="text-teal-500">$500</span>, but they are now
  on sale for <span className="text-teal-500">$369</span> each one, so for a
  total of <span className="text-orange-500">$738</span> you are taking home the
  'Ferrari' my friend. Literally the best studio speakers in the market. And
  last but not least, there are white versions for the HS5, HS7, and HS8.
