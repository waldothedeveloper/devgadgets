the_gist: So, you've done a few courses and read a few books but still don't feel great about your relationship with JavaScript. How do you get better? Build things. Lots of things. Build 1,000 things. Keep it up and don't stop. Seriously. This has always been my advice. Just put in the work and you will get better. But Wes, what should I build? I have no ideas! Please don't make me do another todo app. Ideas, Eh? I've got lots! This is JavaScript30 â€” let's build 30 things together.
