    I'm a web developer, teacher and speaker from Hamilton, Ontario ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I'm 32
    years old and I've been making websites for about 20 years. I use HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript. Though constantly changing, my focus right now is React.js,
    Node, Express, Lambda, Gatsby and Next.js. I create online courses and run a

    I've been in love with web development for over half my life. Seems weird,
    right? It's a space of constant improvement and new & exciting technology. I
    consider myself a hacker in that I'm always using technology to solve my
    life's problems and ambitions.

    I love to teach. I got my start teaching with Ladies Learning Code and went
    on to teach part time and full time bootcamps at HackerYou (Now Juno
    College). I now spend my time making courses, doing workshops and speaking
    at conferences around the world.

    I live in a really cool city called Hamilton in its downtown core in a super
    old house with my wife Kaitlin, two girls, one boy and a pup named Snickers.
    We spend our summers at our cottage up in beautiful Northern Ontario.

    I have a few hobbies. I've rebuilt hundreds of vintage road racing bikes. I
    like to fancy myself as a good cook, Iâ€™m obsessed with cast iron cookware,
    smoking meat on my Big Green Egg and have been known to make some pretty
    killer pulled pork. I've recently dipped my toes into fermentation and
    curing.
